# Secure JWT Implementation in CoinPayPortal

**ID:** vuln-0001
**Severity:** NONE
**Found:** 2026-02-07 10:34:25 UTC
**Target:** Repository: CoinPayPortal

## Description

The JWT implementation in CoinPayPortal was analyzed. The focus was on ensuring correct usage of signing algorithms and proper implementation of JWT signature verifications.

## Impact

The implementation of JWT ensures secure token generation and verification using HS256. There is not any algorithm downgrade vulnerability.

## Technical Analysis

The examination showed that `.ts` files contain logic for JWT operations using the `jsonwebtoken` library. Tokens are signed and verified using the specified algorithm HS256. Handling for expired and invalid tokens is done explicitly, with functions for decoding JWTs without validation also provided safely for flexibility.

## Proof of Concept

Review of critical methods involved in token handling indicates adherence to secure JWT practices - no vulnerabilities related to RS256 to HS256 downgrades. Verification consistently uses HS256 as the hoped-for setting.

```
console.log("No exploit code applicable as implementation adheres to secure JWT standards.");
```

## Code Analysis

**File:** /workspace/coinpayportal/src/lib/auth/jwt.ts

## Remediation

No immediate remediation required given HS256 usage congruent with project requirements. Algorithm choice must align with intended security modes (e.g., RS256 for asymmetric needs).
