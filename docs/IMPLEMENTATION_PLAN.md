## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Private key compromise** → Encryption, key rotation, monitoring
2. **Blockchain congestion** → Gas price limits, retry logic
3. **RPC provider downtime** → Multiple providers, fallback
4. **Database failure** → Automated backups, replication

### Business Risks
1. **Regulatory changes** → Legal consultation, compliance monitoring
2. **Market volatility** → Real-time rates, quick forwarding
3. **Competition** → Unique features, excellent UX
4. **Scaling issues** → Serverless architecture, caching

## Next Steps

1. **Review this plan** - Ensure alignment with requirements
2. **Prioritize features** - Identify must-haves vs nice-to-haves
3. **Set timeline** - Adjust phases based on resources
4. **Begin implementation** - Start with Phase 1 (Foundation)

## Questions for Discussion

1. Do you want to start with all blockchains or phase them in?
2. Should we implement testnet support first?
3. What's the priority: speed to market or feature completeness?
4. Do you have existing infrastructure we should integrate with?
5. What's your preferred deployment platform (Vercel, AWS, etc.)?
